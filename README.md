 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

Our overall approach to this project was to figure out how all of the classes would interact with each other and work from there. While working on this project, we considered making separate classes for each location, but decided against it because we found ourselves rewriting a significant amount of code. Last minute, we decided to include a graph and learn about Guava, which probably wasn't the most logical choice. We did learn a lot about Guava, but would like to learn more in the future. If we had unlimited time, we would definitely like to investigate Guava more and also add graphics. The most helpful piece of feedback was probably including a graph to allow the player to move between locations, and some of our peers gave us that advice while Professor Crouser taught us about how to set up graphs. If we could give our past selves advice, it would be to not underestimate the scale of this project. It's safe to say that we both assumed it would be a lot easier and less work, however, it proved to be more challenging. We both came up with the idea together and were both excited to work on this project, so our team dynamic definitely reflected that. We both showed interest and initiative while working.
